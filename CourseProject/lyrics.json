 "lyrics": "Fake Plastic Trees Lyrics[Verse 1]\nA green plastic watering can\nFor a fake Chinese rubber plant\nIn a fake plastic earth\nThat she bought from a rubber man\nIn a town full of rubber plants\nTo get rid of itself\n\n[Chorus 1]\nIt wears her out\nIt wears her out\nIt wears her out\nIt wears her out\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe lives with a broken man\nA cracked polystyrene man\nWho just crumbles and burns\nHe used to do surgery\nFor girls in the eighties\nBut gravity always wins\n[Chorus 2]\nAnd it wears him out\nIt wears him out\nIt wears him out\nIt wears\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe looks like the real thing\nShe tastes like the real thing\nMy fake plastic love\nBut I can't help the feeling\nI could blow through the ceiling\nIf I just turn and run\n\n[Chorus 3]\nAnd it wears me out\nIt wears me out\nIt wears me out\nIt wears me out\n\n[Outro]\nAnd if I could be who you wanted\nIf I could be who you wanted\nAll the time\nAll the time81Embed"
